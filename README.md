# BayesianOptimization-nanoporous
This repository contains the Python code developed for optimizing nanoporous materials using Bayesian Optimization (BO). This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed: - NumPy - PyTorch - GPyTorch - BoTorch.
Running the BO.py file will give the result as well as the corresponding plot.
Running the Bayesian.py file will generate the sample plot for Bayesian Optimization and 1st_Figure.py will generate data distribution plot.
